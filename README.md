# Agility_Record_Keeper

## General Information

This is a desktop application that will (eventually) hold the records for any number of dogs compteting in agility trials. At the current time, only AKC trials are available but this may when the program is actually functional. 

Main purposes of this program are to someday have a mobile application that would allow people to track their agility runs at trials directly on their phones, tablets, etc. instead of needing to either write everything down or use a desktop application (please see Acknowledgements for a current desktop application).

## To Do

This is an unfinished project with lots of work to be done. A file called to_do.txt gives an overview of what is being worked on currently. 

* Note: The author is both finishing up a graduate degree and searching for employment so this will most likely not be a finished project any time soon.


## Technical Information

To run the current program, Python3 is needed and should already include Tkinter within the Python Standard Library. In order to execute the program use the command
```
python3 agility_app.py
```

The backend is currently JSON. If a mobile application is created and this is not the best option, YAML or SQL may be used for data storage.

Currently, tkinter is generating the GUI. It is not necessarily the best looking application for this so that will eventually change, the author is just most familiar with it at the moment and uses it for initial concept design.

## Acknowledgements

This i highly based off of Agility Record Book, https://agilityrecordbook.com/, and is being implemented to further this work by adding a mobile application.
